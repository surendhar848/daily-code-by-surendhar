 ðŸ’» Daily Code Practice by Surendhar

Welcome to my daily code practice repo! ðŸš€  
This repository is where I commit daily progress as I work on:

- React.js component building
- Laravel backend structure (routes, controllers, views)
- SQL query writing and optimization
- DevOps tools exploration (Git, CI/CD basics, shell scripts)
- DSA problems from HackerRank
- Small UI & full-stack projects
